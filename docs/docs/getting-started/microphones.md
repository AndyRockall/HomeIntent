# Microphones
Home Intent can work with any USB powered microphone, however, it'll work best with microphones designed to pick up voice that can do some amount of background noise cancellation. A lot of times these are conference microphone "pucks" or custom built mic arrays.

Here are a few microphone options that are known to do well:

 * Jabra Speak 410 (the 510 and other bluetooth options are more trouble than they are worth)
 * Playstation Eye Camera

## Future Support
Home Intent will likely support the following Raspberry Pi Hats in the future. We need to enable a config to set the audio driver in the Rhasspy Profile and the [drivers](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/#respeaker-drivers) need to be installed. We haven't tested them personally, but they are known to work well with Rhasspy. 
 
 * ReSpeaker 4 Mic Array
 * ReSpeaker 2 Mics Pi HAT

If you find any other microphones that can do well, let us know! I want to try out a microphone comparison at some point, but that will likely come a bit later.
