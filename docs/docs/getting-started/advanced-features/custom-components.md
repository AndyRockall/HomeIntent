# Custom Components - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
Custom components can be installed in `/config/custom_components/<component_name>` and will be loaded on startup. Home Intent will go through it's `config.yaml` try to load from it's `components` and then load from `custom_components`.

More information on creating components can be found in the [example component docs](/developer-reference/example-component).

We'll try to publish a list of custom components here.
